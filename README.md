## Design prolems in Aerosol Technology

There are two example desing problems: Diffusional losses in a laminar pipe flow and change of a number distribution due to coagulation. 

Both problems are soved numerically and validated with analytical solutions. 

Finally there is a new problem statement for curent students of the course.
